# What is exploratory data analysis? {#what-is-eda}

Data analysis is a process of cleaning, transforming,
inspecting and modelling data with the aim of extracting
information.


Data analysis includes:

* exploratory data analysis,
* confirmatory data analysis, and
* initial data analysis.

In a confirmatory data analysis, the focus is on statistical inference and includes processes such as testing hypothesis, model
selection, or predictive modelling.
