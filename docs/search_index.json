The abundance metric differ between species. Would you compare the .gray80[abundance of spiders on a Bt variety] to the .gray80[abundance of thrips on a isogenic variety]? 7.2 Maize kernels Plant pathologist Associate plant pathologist Professor of agronomy Assistant professor of agronomy Professor of philosophy Biologist Biologist (also author) Assistant in biology Data entry clerk (a.k.a. “Computer”) Farmer Professor of plant physiology Instructor in plant physiology Assistant in plant physiology Assistant in plant physiology Professor of biology 4 maize ears selected. 15 observers asked to classify kernels to (i) starchy yellow, (ii) starchy white, (iii) sweet yellow or (iv) sweet white.

(g1 + labs(tag = &quot;&quot;, title = &quot;Observer 1 only&quot;)) / (g1 %+% df2A + labs(title = &quot;All observers&quot;, tag = &quot;&quot;)) Comparable variables and sources Data collected by different sources may have different rules. E.g. in Australia, “a COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID19 (e.g. trauma)”[1] .gray80[Do other countries use the same definition?] The COVID-19 death data often have delays in reporting and data would be updated or corrected later. 7.4 Multi-environment soybean trial 58 soy varieties are grown in four locations in Queensland in 1970 then 1971. Soy breeders are interested in finding the “best” variety. So which variety is the best for yield? australia.soybean %&gt;% mutate(gen = reorder(gen, yield)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(gen, yield, color = loc, shape = as.factor(year))) + geom_point(size = 3) + labs(x = &quot;Genotype&quot;, y = &quot;Yield (tons/hectare)&quot;, shape = &quot;Year&quot;, color = &quot;Location&quot;) + scale_color_discrete_qualitative() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) 7.5 Types of comparison Is the interest to find the best variety for a location? In that case, should the comparison be within location? Or is the interest to find the overall best variety at any location? Comparisons may be specific or general. A different type of comparison may require a different calculation or graphic for investigation. ggplot(australia.soybean, aes(env, yield, group = gen)) + geom_point(size = 6, color = &quot;gray&quot;) + geom_line(size = 1.3, color = &quot;gray&quot;) + geom_point(data = filter(australia.soybean, gen %in% c(&quot;G49&quot;, &quot;G48&quot;, &quot;G50&quot;)), aes(color = gen), size = 6) + geom_line(data = filter(australia.soybean, gen %in% c(&quot;G49&quot;, &quot;G48&quot;, &quot;G50&quot;)), aes(color = gen), size = 1.3) + scale_color_discrete_qualitative() + labs(x = &quot;Environment&quot;, y = &quot;Yield&quot;, color = &quot;Genotype&quot;) 7.6 Weight of calves with different diets 67 calves born in 1975 across 11 herds are fed of one of three diets with low, medium or high energy with their initial and final weights recorded.

Weight gain doesn’t take into account the initial weight though. We could consider computing the relative weight gain with respect to its initial weight. g1 &lt;- urquhart.feedlot %&gt;% mutate(diet = factor(diet, levels = c(&quot;High&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;))) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(diet, weight2 - weight1, color = diet)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;Weight gain&quot;, color = &quot;Diet&quot;) + guides(color = FALSE) g2 &lt;- urquhart.feedlot %&gt;% mutate(diet = factor(diet, levels = c(&quot;High&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;))) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(diet, (weight2 - weight1)/weight1, color = diet)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;Relative weight\\ngain&quot;, color = &quot;Diet&quot;) + guides(color = FALSE) g1 + g2 7.7 Swiss bank notes Comparisons are not always based on point estimates.
