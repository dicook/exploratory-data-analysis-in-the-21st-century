Data analysis is a process of cleaning, transforming, inspecting and modelling data with the aim of extracting information. Data analysis includes: exploratory data analysis, confirmatory data analysis, and initial data analysis. Before modelling and predicting, data should first be explored to uncover the patterns and structures that exist. Exploratory data analysis involves both numerical and visual techniques designed to reveal interesting information that may be hidden in the data. However, an analyst must be cautious not to over-interpret apparent patterns, and to make efforts assess the results of a data exploration are reliable for the data being studied and potentially for new data. In a confirmatory data analysis, the focus is on statistical inference and includes processes such as testing hypothesis, model selection, or predictive modelling. Initial data analysis is an important part of this, to check the sometimes strict assumptions made in order to conduct inference. 2.1 What do experts say? EDA today is prevalent, and there are many descriptions. It’s interesting to compare and contrast these, in relation to the original scope. From wikipedia &gt; In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. In Wickham and Grolemund (2017) &gt; EDA is not a formal process with a strict set of rules. More than anything, EDA is a state of mind. During the initial phases of EDA you should feel free to investigate every idea that occurs to you. Some of these ideas will pan out, and some will be dead ends. The National Institute of Standards and Technology &gt; Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to (1) maximize insight into a data set; (2) uncover underlying structure; (3) extract important variables; (4) detect outliers and anomalies; (5) test underlying assumptions; (6) develop parsimonious models; and (7) determine optimal factor settings. The predictive analytics competition site Kaggle says &gt; What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)? (1) How to ensure you are ready to use machine learning algorithms in a project? (2) How to choose the most suitable algorithms for your data set? (3) How to define the feature variables that can potentially be used for machine learning? Legacy data analysis software system SAS says &gt; EDA is necessary for the next stage of data research. If there was an analogy to exploratory data analysis, it would be that of a painter examining their tools and available time, before deciding on what best to paint. The massive online John Hopkins EDA class describes it as &gt; These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data. General information site Towards Data Science says &gt; The purpose of doing the Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is to find new information in data. The understanding of EDA that practitioners may not aware of, is the EDA uses a visually-examined dataset to understand and summarize the main characteristics of the dataset without having a prior hypothesis or relying upon statistical models. 2.2 Differentiating from traditional analysis 2.2.1 From the case study In 1995 I (Di), as a newly fledged assistant professor, was asked to teach a Business Statistics course. In the process of looking for appropriate examples, I found a book titled “Practical Data Analysis: Case Studies in Business Statistics” by Bryant and Smith (bryantsmith1995?). 2.2.2 What would be EDA 2.2.3 General strategy for EDA 2.2.4 Isn’t it data snooping? 2.2.5 Why aren’t there more resources on EDA? 2.3 The origins of EDA References "]]
